# OrderedArrayList

I was unsure of how to edit my ReadMe file, so I asked my group about that

I was unsure whether to call the superclass constructor, so I asked my group and they
said I needed to add a constructor to my class, which only calls the superconstructor

I was unsure of how to override the add() method, and my group reminded me I could call
the super method add() within the overridden method
